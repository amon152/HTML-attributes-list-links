            Maasai Mara, also sometimes spelled Masai Mara and locally known
            simply as The Mara, is a large national game reserve in Narok,
            Kenya, contiguous with the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. It
            is named in honor of the Maasai people, the ancestral inhabitants of
            the area, who migrated to the area from the Nile Basin. Their
            description of the area when looked at from afar: "Mara" means
            "spotted" in the local Maasai language, due to the many short bushy
            trees which dot the landscape.
